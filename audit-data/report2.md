# Protocol Summary

### Secure Password Storage Smart Contract

**Purpose**:  
This smart contract is designed to securely store and retrieve passwords on the blockchain, ensuring that only authorized users can access their passwords while mitigating potential security vulnerabilities inherent to on-chain data storage.

**Core Functionality**:
- **Password Storage**: Users can store their passwords securely on the blockchain.
- **Password Retrieval**: Only the user who stored the password can retrieve it.
- **Access Control**: Access to password management functions is restricted to the owner (the user who set the password).

**Security Analysis**:
- **On-Chain Data Exposure (H-1)**:
  - **Issue**: Passwords, even marked as private, are publicly accessible on the blockchain.
  - **Mitigation**: Encrypt passwords off-chain before storing them on-chain, and remove functions that might expose the data.
- **Unauthorized Access (H-2)**:
  - **Issue**: The `setPassword` function lacks access control, allowing anyone to change the password.
  - **Mitigation**: Implement an ownership check to ensure only the contract owner can modify the password.

**Naming Conventions**:
- **Event Naming (L-1)**: Use descriptive event names (e.g., `PasswordUpdated`) to improve clarity and maintainability.
- **Error Naming (G-1)**: Simplify error names (e.g., `NotOwner`) to reduce gas costs and enhance readability.

**Compiler Version Management (M-1)**:
- **Issue**: The contract locks to a specific compiler version, which may lead to compatibility issues.
- **Mitigation**: Use a version range (e.g., `^0.8.18`) to allow for updates while maintaining compatibility.

**Conclusion**:  
The audit identifies critical and non-critical vulnerabilities in the protocol's password storage mechanism. While the protocol provides essential functionalities for secure password storage, implementing the recommended mitigations is crucial to ensuring the protocol's security and robustness.

The KineticsOfWeb3 team makes all efforts to identify as many vulnerabilities as possible within the given time period but holds no responsibility for the findings provided in this document. A security audit by the team is not an endorsement of the underlying business or product. The audit was time-boxed, and the review of the code focused solely on the security aspects of the Solidity implementation of the contracts.

# Risk Classification

# Audit Details

The findings described in this document correspond to the following commit hash:

```
7d55682ddc4301a7b13ae9413095feffd9924566
```

## Scope

The audit focused on the security aspects of the Password Store smart contract, specifically evaluating the following components:

- `PasswordStore` contract's functions, state variables, and event handling.
- Access control mechanisms.
- Compliance with Solidity best practices.
- Gas efficiency of the contract.

## Roles

- **Owner**: The user who has the authority to set and view the password.
- **Outsiders**: No one else is allowed to read or set the password.

# Executive Summary

The Password Store smart contract was audited with a focus on identifying potential security vulnerabilities and adherence to Solidity best practices. The audit uncovered several issues, including two critical vulnerabilities that could severely compromise the security and functionality of the contract.

## Issues Found

- **High Severity**: 2 issues
- **Medium Severity**: 1 issue
- **Low Severity**: 1 issue
- **Informational**: 1 issue
- **Gas Efficiency Concerns**: 1 issue  
  **Total**: 6 issues

# Findings

## High Severity

<details>
<summary><strong>[H-1] On-Chain Visibility of "Private" Variables</strong></summary>

### Likelihood & Impact:
- **Impact**: HIGH
- **Likelihood**: HIGH
- **Severity**: HIGH

**Description**:  
All data stored on-chain is accessible to anyone, regardless of the Solidity visibility keyword used. In this case, the `PasswordStore::s_password` variable is intended to be private and only accessed through the `PasswordStore::getPassword` function, which is designed to be callable only by the contract owner. However, because blockchain data is publicly accessible, the password is not truly private.

**Proof of Concept**:  
The following steps demonstrate how anyone can retrieve the password directly from the blockchain:

1. Set up a local blockchain:
    ```bash
    make anvil
    ```

2. Deploy the contract:
    ```bash
    make deploy
    ```

3. Read the stored password:
    ```bash
    cast storage <Contract_Address> 1 --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545
    ```
    The output will resemble:
    ```
    0x6d7950617373776f726400000000000000000000000000000000000000000014
    ```

4. Convert the hexadecimal value to a string:
    ```bash
    cast --parse-bytes32-string 0x6d7950617373776f726400000000000000000000000000000000000000000014
    ```
    This returns:
    ```
    mypassword
    ```

**Recommended Mitigation**:  
To address this vulnerability, the contract's architecture should be reconsidered. One possible solution is to encrypt the password off-chain before storing it on-chain. This approach would require users to maintain an additional off-chain password for decryption. Additionally, it would be wise to remove the view function to prevent users from inadvertently exposing the password when making a transaction.

<summary><strong>[H-2] Lack of Access Control on <code>setPassword</code> Function</strong></summary>

### Likelihood & Impact:
- **Impact**: CRITICAL
- **Likelihood**: HIGH
- **Severity**: CRITICAL

**Description**:  
The `setPassword` function in the `PasswordStore` contract lacks proper access control. Currently, the function is external, which means anyone can call this function and set the password to a new value without any restrictions.

**Impact**:  
This issue allows any external party to change the stored password without permission, which could lead to unauthorized access or loss of integrity of the stored data. The lack of access control undermines the contract's security by exposing critical functionality to unauthorized users.

**Proof of Concept**:
```javascript
// Current vulnerable function in the contract:
function setPassword(string memory newPassword) external {
    s_password = newPassword;
    emit SetNetPassword();
}

// Any external address can call this function:
address attacker = 0xAttackerAddress;
attacker.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("setPassword(string)", "newMaliciousPassword"));
```

**Recommended Mitigation**:  
Implement an access control mechanism by adding a modifier to check if `msg.sender` is the owner of the contract before allowing the password to be set. This ensures that only the owner can modify the password.

```javascript
// Access control modifier to restrict function to owner only
modifier onlyOwner() {
    if (msg.sender != s_owner) {
        revert NotOwner();
