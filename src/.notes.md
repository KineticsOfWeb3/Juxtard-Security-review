Attack Vectors

Access control issues can vary in severity depending on the context and the specific vulnerability. Here's how it generally breaks down:

1. High Severity (High Findings)
   Access control issues are considered high severity when they allow unauthorized users to perform critical actions that can compromise the entire system or result in significant financial loss. Examples include:

Unauthorized fund transfers: If a smart contract allows anyone to transfer funds or drain the contract’s balance without proper checks.
Administrative functions: If an attacker can gain access to functions that allow them to upgrade the contract, change key parameters, or take ownership of the contract. 2. Medium Severity (Medium Findings)
Access control issues might be considered medium severity when they allow unauthorized users to perform non-critical but still significant actions. Examples include:

Unauthorized data changes: If a smart contract allows unauthorized users to modify non-fundamental data, such as updating a user profile or setting a variable that doesn’t directly result in loss of funds.
Viewing sensitive information: If unauthorized users can access sensitive information that might not be financial but could still be exploited. 3. Low Severity or Informational
In cases where the impact of an access control issue is minimal or it only leads to potential inconveniences without major consequences, it might be considered low severity. Examples include:

Minor data exposure: If the contract reveals non-critical information to unauthorized users that doesn’t directly compromise the contract or users.
Low-impact functions: If unauthorized users can call functions that don’t have a significant impact on the contract's operations or user data. 4. It Depends
The severity of an access control issue also depends on the specific functionality of the contract and the potential impact of unauthorized access. For example:

In a smart contract handling millions of dollars in assets, weak access control on fund transfer functions would be high severity.
In a simple data storage contract with no financial implications, unauthorized access to set or get data might be considered medium or even low severity, depending on the context.
Conclusion
Access control issues are typically classified as high or medium severity, depending on the impact they can have on the contract’s security and the potential damage that could result from exploitation. If the issue leads to unauthorized access to critical functions, it’s usually high severity. If it affects non-critical functions, it might be medium or low severity.
